# NFT Based warrenty system 

[Project Proposal Click here](/assets/Blockchain%20proposal.pdf)

The concept of warranties has been around for a long time, with the primary goal of providing customers with peace of mind when purchasing products. However, warranty management is a cumbersome process for consumers and manufacturers. With physical warranty cards, there are issues of loss, damage, and falsification. Additionally, customers may need help keeping track of warranty periods, and manufacturers can need help tracking the products still covered by the warranty. Our solution offers a revolutionary approach to warranty management by digitizing the entire process using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By converting physical warranty cards into digital NFTs, we provide customers and manufacturers with a seamless warranty management experience. With our solution, customers can easily access their digital NFTs to prove the authenticity of their products, verify ownership, and transfer ownership during resale. The NFTs used in our solution are linked to each product on the blockchain, providing a secure and tamper-proof warranty management method. Using the blockchain ensures that the warranty information is decentralized, immutable, and transparent, allowing manufacturers to track the products' ownership and warranty periods easily. The Polygon blockchain is the perfect platform for our solution, offering low transaction fees and high scalability, making it cost-effective and efficient. Our solution offers numerous advantages over traditional warranty management systems. With digital NFTs, there is no risk of loss or damage to physical warranty cards.
Additionally, there is no possibility of falsification of the warranty, as the NFTs are cryptographically secured on the blockchain. This makes it easier to track warranty claims and identify fraudulent activities. One significant benefit of our solution is that it gives customers complete control over their warranty management. They can easily access their digital NFTs, track the warranty periods, and transfer ownership during resale. Customers no longer have to worry about losing their physical warranty cards, forgetting the warranty period, or being unable to prove product ownership. Our solution also benefits manufacturers with a cost-effective and efficient warranty management method. With our solution, manufacturers can easily track the products' requests, warranty periods, and warranty claims, reducing the cost of warranty management. NFTs also enable manufacturers to standardize their warranty programs, ensuring that all warranty claims are treated equally, regardless of the issuer or the time of issuance. Another advantage of our solution is that it enables tracking repairs and replacements to the original item. By linking the NFT to the brand/retailer's warranty program, customers can easily track the status of their warranty claims, ensuring that their products are being repaired or replaced within the warranty period. This gives customers an added layer of transparency and trust in the warranty management process. Using NFTs in our solution also provides opportunities for new possibilities in warranty management. For instance, the number of warranty transfers of a product can be limited and controlled through NFTs. Some warranties are non-transferable to new owners, whereas others offer unlimited transfers. Tokenized warranties can accurately enforce these rules, preventing the unauthorized transfer of warranties. Furthermore, the use of NFTs enables the tracing of a product's exact ownership chain. By linking the NFT to the blockchain, manufacturers can easily trace a product's ownership history, providing valuable insights into its life cycle. This information can be used to improve the quality of the products, provide better customer support, and track the products' environmental impact. Our solution is demonstrated as a web prototype, showcasing its user-friendly and efficient design. The prototype is easy to navigate, and customers can easily access their digital NFTs and track the status of their warranty claims. Using the Polygon blockchain ensures that transactions are fast and cost-effective.
